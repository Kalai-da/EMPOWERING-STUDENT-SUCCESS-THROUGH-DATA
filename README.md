<strong> A school is taking the data driven initiative approach to resolve - the difficulty in ensuring equitable education and meeting each student’s unique academic needs effectively.</strong>
<strong>  As a Data Analyst, my goal for this project is twofold </strong>
    <li> Ensure that students who have previously struggled or failed are able to meet the minimum passing criteria.</li>
    <li> Elevate overall academic performance by helping students improve their grades incrementally. Through targeted analysis and insights, I aim to drive meaningful improvements in student outcomes, supporting both baseline achievement and excellence.</li><br>
